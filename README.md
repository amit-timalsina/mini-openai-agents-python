## Components of an agentic system
On top of my mind i can only think of below. This will evolve as we go.

1. LLM Model
2. Agent
3. Tools
4. Orchestrator (Handoffs)
5. Memory
6. Observability
7. Guardrails
8. Evaluation

## What am doing right now?
I am adding raw examples by using openai python sdk.
I didn't want to prematurely create abstraction.
So, first i will just write raw code then after enough examples i will start creating good abstraction and convert this into a sdk of it's own.
